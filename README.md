# data_driven_convex_regularization
This repo contains python scripts for implementating data-driven convex regularization for inverse problems (sparse-view CT reconstruction in particular). For a detailed description of the algorithm and theoretical results, see: https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02839.

If you use these scripts in your research, consider citing the paper:
